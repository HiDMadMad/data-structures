# binary tree :

## structure :
1️⃣ a data
2️⃣ pointer to left-child
3️⃣ pointer to right-child

## number of different binary trees with 'n' nodes :
for binary tree 't' with root 'r' :
->  n=0  ->  t(n) = 1
|
->  n>=1  ->  t(n) =  sum of(i=1 to n) :  t(i-1) * t(n-i)
|
-> in general(catalan numbers) -> t(n) = (1/(n+1)) * (choose n of 2n)
