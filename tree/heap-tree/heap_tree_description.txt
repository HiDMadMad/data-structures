# heap

## max heap
1️⃣ root-value >= sub-value
2️⃣ root has biggest value

### insert at max heap
1️⃣ insert at last place of array
2️⃣ compare that with each root-value
2️⃣1️⃣ if it's bigger than the root value -> replace it with root

### remove from max heap
1️⃣ root is removed
2️⃣ it compares with it's biggest sub
2️⃣1️⃣ if it's smaller than it's biggest sub -> replace them

🔴 heap is only way to implement the priority-queue

------------------------------------
## min heap
1️⃣ root-value <= sub-value
2️⃣ root has lowest value

🔴 it's inverse of max-heap
