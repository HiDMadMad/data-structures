tree :
 each node is a tree(even by it self)

node :
 an element of a tree

root :
 a node with no parent

leaf :
 a node with no children

sibling :
 nodes with the same parent

forest :
 a collection of trees



ancestors :
 all nodes on the path from a node to the root

descendants :
 all nodes in a tree or subtree with a given root

sub tree :
 a node and all nodes below it (a node with all of its descendants)

internal node :
 all nodes except leaf nodes



tree depth :
 root is at depth 0 and each lower node is one level deeper

node depth :
 given node is at depth 0 and each lower node is one level deeper

tree height :
 maximum path length from the root to a leaf

node hight :
 maximum path length from a node to a leaf
 
JUST A TIP :
 when we go down from the root, depth increases
 and height decreases because we get closer to the leaves



k-array tree :
 each node can have at most k children

complete k-array tree :
 each node has k children or no children

ordered tree :
 order of children is important

labeled tree :
 each node has a label

balanced tree :
 leaf depths difference at most is one

completely balanced tree :
 all leaf nodes have the same depth

binary tree :
 a k-array tree where k equals 2
 each node has data, a left child, and a right child
 go to ../tree/binary_tree/binary_tree.txt
